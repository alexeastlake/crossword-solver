# word-finder

A tool to find words containing certain letter combinations

## How to Use

Enter partially completed words using "?" for unknown letters. If wanting multiple words in one input, use "-" to separate the words. Once filled out, click the "Search" button.

e.g. wo?d-fi?d?r

If there are more than 100 matches for an input word, the tool will only output the first 100 matches. If this happens consider filling in more unknown letters of the word to make the query more specific.
